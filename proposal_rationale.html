    <p>Jeff Parker, the owner of the COMP 1950 website, has set forth a challenge for his student to come up with a set of proposed changes to the design and style of the website.  Group MVM has answered this challenged, by creating an alternative style, presentation and format for the COMP 1950 website.</p>
    <p>The COMP 1950 website is unique in the sense that this website is specifically designed for the students taking this course, and therefore has a very specific design objective that is identified in the Project Questionnaire.  As indentified in the Project Questionnaire, Jeff Parker is seeking a website that has a clear focus, which is easy for the students to use and navigate.  The purpose of this website is to provide students with information and resources on materials relating to this course; this website will also provide students with exercises and examples, which they could submit through this site, and contains information pertaining to the course curriculum, timetable, room information, grading and BCIT policies.  Having information convey in a simple to understand fashion is another important feature identified by Mr. Parker.</p>
    <p>In the following links, Group MVM has addressed the designed objectives identified in the Project Questionnaire in their four proto-site web pages.</p>
