    <p>Jeff Parker, the owner of the COMP 1950 website, has set forth a challenge for his student to come up with a set of proposed changes to the design and style of the website.  Group MVM has answered this challenged, by creating an alternative style, presentation and format for the COMP 1950 website.</p>
    <p>The COMP 1950 website is unique in the sense that this website is specifically designed for the students taking this course, and therefore has a very specific design objective that is identified in the Project Questionnaire.  As indentified in the Project Questionnaire, Jeff Parker is seeking a website that has a clear focus, which is easy for the students to use and navigate.  The purpose of this website is to provide students with information and resources on materials relating to this course; this website will also provide students with exercises and examples, which they could submit through this site, and contains information pertaining to the course curriculum, timetable, room information, grading and BCIT policies.  Having information convey in a simple to understand fashion is another important feature identified by Mr. Parker.</p>
    <p>Group MVM redesigned the COMP 1950 website, in order to meet the expectations set forth by the project questionnaire.  This resulted in a complete overhaul of the existing site, with the introduction of a number of innovative new features and more using friendly feel, which were achieved through an alternative layout, colour scheme and format for the website.   This effort was achieved through the combined efforts and talents of the group members, with individual group members focusing on specific aspects of this project.  Specifically, Melanie was graphics designer and wrote the coding for the business site.  Vaidas was graphics designer and wrote the coding of the proto-site.  Mark created the graphics for the sitemap, logo and favicon and wrote the content for the business side of this project.</p>
